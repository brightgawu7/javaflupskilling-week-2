## Comparison between bubble  and selection sort algorithms

---

### Time Complexity Comparison

* Bubble Sort (O(n^2))
* Selection Sort (O(n^2))

---

### Discussion of Use Cases

* Bubble Sort
    * Suitable for small datasets or when simplicity is prioritized over efficiency.
    * Not recommended for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.

* Selection Sort
    * Suitable for small datasets or when simplicity is prioritized over efficiency.
    * Not recommended for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.

## Conclusion

```
Bubble sort and selection sort are simple sorting algorithms suitable for small datasets or when simplicity is
prioritized over efficiency. However, they are not recommended for large datasets due to their quadratic time
complexity. For larger datasets, more efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort, quick sort, or heap sort should be
preferred.
