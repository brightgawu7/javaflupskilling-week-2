## Comparison between linear and binary search algorithms

---

### Time Complexity Comparison

* Linear search (O(n))
* Binary search (O(log(n)))

---

### Discussion of Use Cases

* Linear Search:
    * Suitable for small arrays or unsorted arrays.
    * Useful when the array is not sorted and the overhead of sorting is not justified.

      #### Pros
        * Simple to implement.
        * Works efficiently on small datasets.
        * No requirement for the array to be sorted.

      #### Cons
        * Inefficient for large datasets due to its linear time complexity.
        * Not suitable for sorted arrays as binary search offers better performance.

----

* Binary Search
    * Suitable for large, sorted arrays.
    * Provides a much faster search for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.

  #### Pros
    * Efficient for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
    * Guarantees a fast search time, especially on sorted arrays.
    * Reduces the search space by half with each comparison.

  #### Cons
    * Requires the array to be sorted initially, which may add overhead if the array frequently changes.

## Conclusion

* Linear Search:
    * Choose for small or unsorted datasets.
    * When simplicity is prioritized over performance.


* Binary Search:
    * Choose for large datasets, especially when efficiency is crucial.
    * When the array is sorted, or sorting overhead is acceptable.
    * When a fast search time is required.
